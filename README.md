# Calculator
This is just a calculator.

On one day my brother and I had an argument about whether I could write a calculator in 2 hours. In June 18th 2020, I wrote it, but due to the fact that I used the conditions and checks, my window was closed after the result was displayed.
It took 5 hours (if you count hours in a row) and here it is.
Today is June 21, 2020.

Today is December 11, 2020 and I opened to correct one small flaw. When I tried to do response operations I kept crashing out. Today I opened and fixed this bug with one small line (147 line).

Today is December 28, 2020 and I fixed another little bug when I checked the code on PEP8.

In total, it took about 6 hours to develop it.
